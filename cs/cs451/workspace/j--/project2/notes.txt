1. Provide a high-level description (ie, using minimal amount of technical
   jargon) of the project in no more than 200 words.

      Began problem 1 by understanding multiline comments then modify Scanner.java to support multiline
   comment by seeing it as a whitespace character.
      Began problems 2, 3 and 4 by defining tokens in TokenInfo.java then modifying Scanner.java to 
   recognize it by adding and modifying cases while adding reserved words in the hashtable.

2. Did you receive help from anyone? List their names, status (classmate, 
   CS451/651 grad, TA, other), and the nature of help received.

   Name               Status       Help Received
   ----               ------       -------------

   N/A                N/A          N/A

3. List any other comments here. Feel free to provide any feedback on how
   much you learned from doing the assignment, and whether you enjoyed
   doing it.

   Modified TokenInfo.java to be sorted alphabetically. I learned how to easily add operators and reserved words in j--.
   Adding support for long and double literal was straight forward.
