1. Provide a high-level description (ie, using minimal amount of technical
   jargon) of the project in no more than 200 words.
      > For Problem 1, it was similar to GenFactorial.java from compilation slides in the course website, so most of the parts are from there, and finally created
   a new method IsPrime.
      > For Problems 2 - 4, it was all similar. Looked through all the methods and fields from the given (i.e. 'star' symbol), so most parts of these problems are
   from the other methods but tweaked to function in their own (i.e. IDIV instead of IMUL). Got every arithmetic instructs from CLEmitter.java.

2. Did you receive help from anyone? List their names, status (classmate, 
   CS451/651 grad, TA, other), and the nature of help received.

   Name               Status       Help Received
   ----               ------       -------------
   N/A                N/A          N/A

3. List any other comments here. Feel free to provide any feedback on how
   much you learned from doing the assignment, and whether you enjoyed
   doing it.

   I learned how CLEmitter works in j--.
