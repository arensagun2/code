1. Provide a high-level description (ie, using minimal amount of technical
   jargon) of the project in no more than 200 words.

   The project is another enhancement for j-- that has 5 major goals. It adds support for Long and Double data types, to enable j-- to work with
   larger numbers and real numbers. It also adds support for logical and math operators to facilitate complex calculations. This project enables j--
   to handle conditional expressions and various control flows like loops, break and continue statements. It implements error-handling capabilities by
   adding support for try-catch blocks and throw statements. Finally, the project extends the compiler j--'s functionality to recognize and process
   interface type declarations.
